#Installing python on a mac
There are two main versions of python, `python 3.x` and `python 2.x`.
The conversation over which one is preferable seems to be
occurring mainly on the side of development using python
(apparently, it is very easy to create GUI apps using a few key python
tools) but it boils down to this (my understanding):
* Python3 is the future of python and we should try to use it as our default
and
* Python3 will break your computer because everything special about python still depends on python2
